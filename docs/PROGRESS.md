# Olive — Build Log (maintained by Claude, per CLAUDE.md file-ownership rule)

Spec source of truth: `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md` (replaced wholesale by Keenan's planning sessions — never annotated here).
This file tracks what's actually built, what's verified, and known gaps.

## Phase 1 — Tasks + daily brief ✅ built (one external blocker)

- Scaffold, Supabase project `dpkdsmvskryettdxcvpp`, single-user auth (signups disabled), RLS on all tables.
- Tables: `categories` (user-defined, seeded 3 with colors), `tasks` (category_id, due_date, scheduled_time, time_section, duration_minutes, priority), `memories`, `daily_briefs`, `daily_schedule_setup`, `dashboard_layouts`.
- NL capture: `assistant` edge fn (Claude tool-use → zod → Postgres), category-aware incl. voice-created categories; preview/commit modes.
- **Voice preview modal**: dictation-detected input parses first, shows the editable breakdown (per-field pencil, X discard, Send off).
- Brief: 7:00 America/Edmonton pg_cron (DST-proof dual firing + in-function guard, Vault-authenticated), on-demand fallback, priorities dropdown (overdue folded in), manual reorder persisted.
- Today's Schedule (time sections), Upcoming Days (today+3 ↔ full week), popup mini calendar, scheduled/not-scheduled tags, category corner tags.
- Tomorrow's-schedule setup icon → `schedule-setup` edge fn (wake time + blocked windows parsed; displayed on Today's Schedule).
- Cross-panel drag-and-drop (dnd-kit): task→section/day-block/priorities-reorder; task↔weekly conversion both ways with undo toast.
- **Customize mode**: pencil ON/OFF; react-grid-layout grid (whole-box drag, e/w horizontal resize, measured heights), editable section titles, per-section "+" adds; persisted per-user in `dashboard_layouts`. Default layout = the spec's two-column split. Item-level drag suspends while ON (they'd steal the pointer).
- Sidebar-only navigation (Dashboard/Tasks/Weekly Tasks/Active Jobs/Journal/Finance/Groceries/Settings; last four reserved placeholders).

**Blocked, not code**: live NL capture + journal cleaning need Anthropic API credits (key is valid, in Vault; account balance is $0 — console.anthropic.com → Plans & Billing).

**Known gaps (deliberately not built yet)**:
- Suggested-schedule pull-forward (fill quiet sections using duration_minutes) and blocked-window avoidance — windows are parsed/stored/shown, nothing avoids them yet.
- Tasks-tab filters (category/status/scheduled).
- Wake-time-shifted section boundaries (sections are labeled buckets, not clock-anchored).
- "Hold-and-drag" for sections = 6px movement threshold, not a timed hold (react-grid-layout has no hold delay).
- Customize drag/resize is desktop-only; mobile pencil reveals "+" adds only.

## Phase 2 — Weekly tasks + journal ✅ built

- `weekly_tasks` (count vs fixed_days modes, target_per_week, scheduled_days, time_section), `weekly_task_checkins` (planned/completed, note, duration).
- 7 independent Mon-first cubes (empty/planned/completed); fixed days auto-light weekly; count mode planned by cube-tap or day-block drag; progress note with consistent arithmetic (unit-tested incl. week/year boundaries).
- Schedule integration: fixed_days appear on their weekdays, count-mode until target met.
- Check-off offers optional note/duration, one tap to skip.
- Journal: one log per day with entry_time per capture; raw→cleaned via `journal-clean` edge fn (coherence-only), both stored, save-raw fallback when API unavailable, re-clean later, editable (raw never editable).

## Operational facts

- Secrets: `anthropic_api_key`, `cron_secret`, `project_url` in Supabase Vault via service-role-only RPCs; local copies in gitignored `.env`/`.env.local`.
- Edge functions: `assistant` (JWT ON), `journal-clean` (ON), `schedule-setup` (ON), `daily-brief` (OFF — cron secret or JWT checked in-function).
- Tests: `npm run test` — dates, ranking, sections, weekly cubes, dashboard layout model.
- Preview quirks (for future sessions): the Browser-pane preview loses auth sessions on restart and screenshots can time out — Keenan's own browser at localhost:5173 is the real verification surface; signed-in checks need him.

## Phases 3–9 — not started (hard gate; explicit approval required)
